# HTTPS
HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is an encrypted version of the HTTP protocol. It usually uses SSL or TLS to encrypt all communication between a client and a server. This secure connection allows clients to safely exchange sensitive data with a server, for example for banking activities or online shopping.

Setting up and maintaining HTTPS can be easy or hard, depending on how much of the configuration is transferred to a third party. For example, setting up HTTPS in case you control the infrastructure, OS, and applications running on it is a lot more involved than simply deploying your application at a cloud provider who takes care of the infrastructure and HTTPS configuration for you. This chapter will guide you along the steps you need to take in case you control everything.
