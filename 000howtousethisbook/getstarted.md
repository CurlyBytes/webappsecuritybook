Welcome to the Software Security gitbook. This book should help you in maintaining the overview of the course and provide you with a written form of the course contents.
I will be copying most information from either the MDN or the OWASP websites. Their licenses are as follows:
* MDN: licensed under CC-BY-SA 2.5.
* OWASP: FLOSS license

These sources allow copying information as long as they are attributed. 

**Never attempt to hack systems that are not your own (including the server infrastructure) unless you get a written permission first. Hacking is prohibited by law. **
