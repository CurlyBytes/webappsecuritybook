# Goal
Evaluate a (free) Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) tool for React OR .NET. SAST tools are source code analyzers which help in secure coding. While Linters are tools that can scan and analyze your code for bugs and common programming mistakes, SAST tools go one step further and analyze your code for security bugs. 
The goal of this assignment is to scan a React or .NET application of your choice using a SAST tool of your choice and interpret the results. I expect you to take (or make) a reasonably large application and find and discuss at least three security issues (of which one major) found by the SAST tool. 

You may deliberately introduce vulnerabilities in case the application you are using does not lead to any useful results. I do expect you to provide a fix for the vulnerabilities discussed (the fix may be commented out in the source code, or may be described in your document).
