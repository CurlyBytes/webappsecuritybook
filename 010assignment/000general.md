# Practicalities
You should form groups of 2 or 3. Each group has to finish one assignment (not all three). The exact assignment will be assigned randomly to the groups. 

# How to deliver the assignment to me
Create one (1) document in the English language in markdown or MS Office or Openoffice format. The filename should contain the text 'team_<yourteamnumber>' and it should contain the following:
* Link to the source code, hosted on Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, or any other source control system. I suggest you work in a private repository, but do make sure to invite me so that I have access to the source code. You can invite mboeynaems(at)outlook(dot)com. 
* The URL of your running application. All assignments involve creating an application of some sort, which must be hosted on the Internet. Several free options to host a website exist (AWS, Netlify, etc.). 
* A high-quality description of the assignment and the results. You should treat me as a customer of yours. I expect a description of the development steps you took. In addition for assignment #2, I expect a detailed description of the results (advantages - disadvantages) along with a recommendation. 

# Deadline
This assignment counts as 45% of the total course grade. The submission deadline is March 18th, 23:59.

# Tools
All of the assignments can be finished by using free tools such as Netlify, Heroku, [Azure for students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/), [AWS educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/), and others. Please contact me in case you think you cannot finish the assignments without having to purchase software.
