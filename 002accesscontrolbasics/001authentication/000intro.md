# Authentication
Authentication is the process of **verifying** an assertion about a user or thing. Most often, the identity of that user or thing is the assertion that is verified during authentication. Authentication therefore follows after identification, which is the process of indicating the identity of a user or thing. 

Human users can authenticate using three factors:
* Something you know (example: password)
* Something you have (example: identity card)
* Something you are (example: fingerprint)

When two or more different factors are combined during the authentication process, we call it multi-factor authentication.
