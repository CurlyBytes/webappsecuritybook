# Authorization
Authorization is the process where requests to access a particular resource should be granted or denied. Authorization is not equivalent to authentication. Authentication is providing and validating identity. Authorization includes the execution rules that determine what functionality and data the user may access, ensuring the proper allocation of access rights after authentication is successful.
