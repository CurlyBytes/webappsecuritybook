# Introduction
The exam involves a written assignment outlining the security strategy taken during your project. This security strategy will have to be defended during a virtual interview. 

# Scoring 
This exam counts for 30% of the total course grade. 

# Possible cases
## Case 1: I'm working on the project
You will already have created a blueprint, and you are currently in the implementation phase.
 
* You are expected to review the _group list_ (attached in Digitap) and make sure it contains the correct project group ID
* You are expected to create a document outlining the security strategy (see below);
* You are expected to apply the concepts you have learned in the Software Security course in the implementation phase;
* You are expected to submit this via Digitap (one per team) before the 15th of June.

## Case 2: I'm not working on the project, since it's not part of my curriculum or since I already passed it in a previous year. However, I do follow / retake the course Software Security
You will not have a blueprint. 

* You are expected to form a group with other 'case 2' students and communicate this group membership to me via email. Groups are between 2 and 3 people max;
* You are expected to create a document outlining the security strategy (see below) based on the example _blueprint_ (attached in Digitap);
* You are expected to submit this via Digitap (one per team) before the 15th of June.

## Case 3: I'm working on the project since I had to retake it, but I passed the Software Security course already (in a previous year)
Great, you are not expected to do anything mentioned here (you will also not be invited for the security strategy defense interview).

## Case 4: I'm working on the project since I had to retake it, and I also had to retake the Software Security course
See case _I'm working on the project_

# Security strategy document
## What is it?
You are employed as a security consultant and are asked to review a blueprint document (case 1 students: your own blueprint, case 2 students: the eample blueprint). You should identify potential risks and provide recommendations to the team that will be implementing it. The scope of these recommendations must cover all topics of the [Software Security course](https://apwt.gitbook.io/software-security/) **in two different contexts**:

1. Context 1: the project/implementation will be hosted inside the premises of a small organization
2. Context 2: the project/implementation will be hosted as SaaS and can be used by multiple large organizations 

Topics where recommendations are expected are the following:
* Context of the project: what are the security / privacy requirements?
* Threat model: what's the threat model? Who / what are we defending against?
* Authentication: how do users authenticate? What are the risks? Is access revoked when users leave AP?
* Authorization: how are users authorized? 
* Secure coding: based on the technologies used, which coding guidelines are most important? How do we make sure we adhere to these guidelines? Do we use a checklist? 
* Release: how did we set up HTTPS?  

Note, given in the list above are simply examples. There may be other things that are important to consider. Please review the course book. 

## How many pages does it have to be?
A good advice is clear and to the point. There is no predetermined best length. A visualization may say more than a thousand words, but may take up more or less space than these thousand words. 
However, I would expect a solid advice to count somewhere between 5 to 10 pages. 

## In which language do I have to create the document
You may create the document in Dutch. If you have already started creating it in English, you can proceed as such. 

## What does the defense look like
On June 23, a +-20-minute interview will be planned with your team. This interview will be separate from the project review interview, which takes place on the same day. 

I will be asking some questions about the recommendations you made. For those who have been implementing the project, I may ask concrete questions about how certain recommendations were implemented or configured. 
In case I have doubts about your understanding of certain concepts, I may ask a theoretical question here and there. Be sure to review the course book before this interview. 

## Questions
A session to ask questions is planned on Wednesday the 5th of May, 09:00. The link to join can be found in the Software Security Teams channel.
