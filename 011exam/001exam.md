# Introduction
Due to the COVID-19 situation the exam format has changed from a digital exam to a written assignment outlining the security strategy taken during your project. This security strategy will have to be defended during a virtual interview. 

# Possible cases
## Case 1: I'm working on the project
You will already have created a blueprint, and you are currently in the implementation phase.
 
* You are expected to create a document outlining the security strategy (see below);
* You are expected to apply the concepts you have learned in the Software Security course in this implementation phase;
* You are expected to submit this via Digitap (one per team) before the 15th of June.

## Case 2: I'm not working on the project, since it's not part of my curriculum or since I already passed it in a previous year. However, I do follow / retake the course Software Security
You will not have a blueprint. 

* You are expected to form a group with other 'case 2' students and communicate this group membership to me via email. Groups are between 2 and 3 people max;
* You are expected to create a document outlining the security strategy (see below) based on the example blueprint of group 6 (attached in Digitap);
* You are expected to submit this via Digitap (one per team) before the 15th of June.

## Case 3: I'm working on the project since I had to retake it, but I passed the Software Security course already (in a previous year)
Great, you are not expected to do anything mentioned here (you will also not be invited for the security strategy defense interview).

## Case 4: I'm working on the project since I had to retake it, and I also had to retake the Software Security course
See case _I'm working on the project_

# Security strategy document
## What is it?
You are employed as a security consultant and are asked to review a blueprint document (case 1 students: your own blueprint, case 2 students: the blueprint of group 6). You should identify potential risks and provide recommendations to the team that will be implementing it. The scope of these recommendations is limited to the contents of the Software Security course. Topics where recommendations are expected are the following:
* Context of the project: what are the security / privacy requirements?
* Threat model: what's the threat model? Who / what are we defending against?
* Authentication: how do users authenticate? What are the risks? Is access revoked when users leave AP?
* Authorization: how are users authorized? 
* Secure coding: based on the technologies used, which coding guidelines are most important? How do we make sure we adhere to these guidelines? Do we use a checklist? 
* Release: how did we set up HTTPS?  

Note, the questions linked to each topic are simply examples. There may be other things that are important to consider. Please review the course book. 

## How many pages does it have to be?
A good advice is clear and to the point. There is no predetermined best length. A visualization may say more than a thousand words, but may take up more or less space than these thousand words. 
However, I would expect a solid advice to count somewhere between 5 to 15 pages. 

## What does the defense look like
On the 17th of June a +-20-minute interview will be planned with your team. This interview will be separate from the project review interview, which takes place on the same day. 

I will be asking some questions about the recommendations you made. For those who have been implementing the project, I may ask concrete questions about how certain recommendations were implemented or configured. 
In case I have doubts about your understanding of certain concepts, I may ask a theoretical question here and there. Be sure to review the course book before this interview. 

## Questions
A session where you can ask questions has been scheduled on May 12th at 9AM. The link to join can be found in the Software Security Teams channel.
