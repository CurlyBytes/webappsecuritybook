# Introduction
For those of you who failed the Software Security & Testing course, it is mandatory to retake both the Security part and the Testing part. This document explains the details of the Security part of the retake. 

# Practicalities
You should complete the retake by yourself. No groups may be formed. 

# Retake contents
The retake requires you to - elaborate upon / fix / answer questions about - your original assignment as well as your security strategy document (which was the exam):
- 45% of the total retake grade: Assignment improvement
- 30% of the total retake grade: Security strategy improvement
- other: see testing

The questions, fixes, additional explanations you must provide me with depend on the group you were part of. The exact things you have to do are documented in an Excel, which has [been uploaded to Digitap here](https://learning.ap.be/pluginfile.php/1175300/mod_folder/content/0/RetakeQuestions.xlsx?forcedownload=1). 

This excel contains two tabs: one tab containing the required assignment improvements and another tab containing the required exam improvements. **Be sure to check both tabs!** You should only use the questions relevant to you. For example, if you were part of group 20 for the assignment, you should only respond to the questions linked to group 20. Similarly, if you were part of case 1 group 2 for the exam, you should only respond to the questions linked to that group. 

# How to deliver the assignment to me
Create one (1) document in the English language in markdown or MS Office or Openoffice format. The filename should contain the text 'retake_yourname' and it should contain the following:
* Part 1: Assignment fixes
* Part 2: Security strategy document fixes

Other formatting requirements are the following:
* You will be asked to fix code. The fixed code can be hosted on Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, or any other source control system. I suggest you work in a private repository, but do make sure to invite me so that I have access to the source code. You can invite  `Mich-b`. 
* Since you will be asked to fix code, you must make sure your application is up and running again. Provide me (in the document) with the URL of your running application. 

# Will there be an oral defense
Yes, a 10-minute virtual interview will be held through Teams on August the 27th. You should have received an invitation. If you have not received an invitation, if you are unable to attend at that time, or if you have to retake the exam but have not received an invitation, contact me as soon as possible: michael.boeynaems@ap.be . 

# Deadline
The submission deadline is August 25th, 23:59. The interview takes place on August the 27th.
